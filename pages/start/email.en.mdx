# Corporate email and Microsoft Exchange Cloud
Since most important business communication is done via email, it's a good idea to log into your email as soon as possible to make sure everything is working properly.

## Login

Email usually looks like `jm√©no@itstep.academy`.

Because email uses two-factor authentication, you need a mobile app from Microsoft called Authenticator ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=cs&gl=US), [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458)), which you need to have installed on your mobile phone in order to log in.

The address to log in is [login.microsoftonline.com](https://login.microsoftonline.com/).

Once you have successfully logged in at the link above, you can go straight to email from [outlook.office.com](https://outlook.office.com/).

# How to succeed in Sintegrum
Every new tutor has an *integration process*. This is done through the Sintegrum interactive system, the link to the system can be found in the email. Sintegrum will test your ability to learn something new quickly and pass it on as knowledge step by step. It then teaches you how to teach, what to do when you are in difficulty and what direction you can take to develop further.

As such, Sintegrum is quite demanding, set aside enough time to study and prepare so that you don't have too much on your plate at once. Two hours of integration are reimbursed.

## Joining Sintegrum
You will receive a short email with your Sintegrum login details. The login is usually an internal email and the password is different to Sintegrum than everyone else.

You do not need a VPN to connect to Sintegrum.

## What you will need
You need to have a webcam ready, as you will be recording during the trial tutorial and expect to record your screen as well. For example, an open source program called [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/cs) is useful for this.

## How long does the integration take?
This is unfortunately very individual. The fastest tutor to my knowledge did everything in half an hour. I assume that the average integration time is about two hours, because two hours are reimbursed.

For me, according to the meter, it took 4 hours, which I spent directly on the Sintegrum website, and slightly over 3 hours, which I spent preparing for the individual "tests".

Directly on the Sintegrum site is a time estimate for each part of the lessons. Adding up all the lessons, the time estimate comes out to 8 hours. 

### Time estimate, automatically calculated via the DevTools Console 
```jsx
let count = 0;
document.querySelectorAll(".estimated_time").forEach((item) => count = count + parseInt(item.innerHTML));

console.log(`total ${count} minutes, or ${parseInt(count / 60)} hours and ${count % 60} minutes`);
// prints in the console: `total: 481 minutes, or 8 hours and 1 minute'
```

## Sintegrum tips
I recommend reading the assignment carefully. It is also a good idea to study or write out the information from the materials beforehand, as the information will be hidden while you are recording the video and will only be available later when you correct the video.

Since most beginners have their first major hitch in Sintegrum when asked *which companies do students work at*, if you can't find them in the infographic, then I'll subtly advise that Airbnb and STB are not there.

## Technical difficulties with Sintegrum
If you have technical difficulties with Sintegrum, you can try contacting support within the system or better yet, email [helpdesk.itstep.org](https://helpdesk.itstep.org/). However, at the moment the helpdesk is only in Russian, for translation I recommend using [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) or [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator).

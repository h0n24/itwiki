# First steps

## Getting Started in IT Step
You've passed the interview and now comes the next challenging part of the journey. Now it's important to get your bearings. Find out what is used for what and how to do it.

## The integration process at Sintegrum
Every new lecturer has an integration process. This is done through the Sintegrum interactive system, the link to the system can be found in the email. Sintegrum will test step by step your ability to quickly learn something new and immediately pass it on as knowledge. It then teaches you how to teach, what to do when you are in difficulty and what direction you can take to develop further.

## The two most important steps
The two most critical steps to get started are setting up the VPN correctly and logging in to your corporate email.

### VPN
A VPN or Virtual Private Network is important to connect to our systems. Many internal systems are not publicly accessible on the web, so you need to have your own VPN account.

### Email
The second important point is the email login. You will get access to your private email. Other emails will already go to your company email inbox. 

Authenticator, a mobile app from Microsoft, is used to log in and you need to have it installed on your mobile phone for logging in.

## Who's Who
You should receive a document in your email called *STRUCTURE*, which tells you who has what responsibilities. Whether it is technical difficulties, communication with students, preparation and translation of materials, technical support for students, or student attendance. I recommend that, especially for managers and administrators, you make a note of their phone number on your cell phone, you never know when it will come in handy.

## What's what

We use a variety of systems within IT Step. Links to these can be found in the email.

### LogBook

LogBook is a system for trainers. For a new tutor, which usually scares newbies, the system is pretty empty. His/her skills will only become apparent after the lessons have been taught.

## Approaches

Check and test that you have access to the following systems. It's a good idea to be prepared before class starts so that you don't have too many at once.

| System | Importance? | Login's | Where to change password |
| ------------- |-------------| ------------- |-----|
| Company Email | Critical, this is where logins and passwords come in | Your Email | In Microsoft Account Settings |
| VPN | Critical, without it you won't connect to Logbook | Your last name without diacritics | Can't, IT technician to resolve |
| LogBook | Critical, without it you can't fill in attendance and points | Your email | As a forgotten password before logging in |
| Remotto | Critical for opening online or parallel classes | Assigned word | Not possible, IT technician to solve |
| MyStat | Important especially for students. For lecturers when solving student problems | Your last name without diacritics | Not possible, solved by IT technician |


### Specific and other approaches
These approaches depend on the assigned tutorial topic.

| System | Login is usually | Where to change password |
| ------------- |-------------| -----|
| Kahoot | Email | Please do not change! |
| Minecraft Education | Email | Handled by the administrator who assigns the licenses |
| TinkerCad | Email | You choose your own access and password |

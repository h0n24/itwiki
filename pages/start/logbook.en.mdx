# LogBook

LogBook is a system for lecturers. For a new tutor, which usually scares newbies, the system is quite empty. His abilities will only become apparent after he's taught the lessons.

## What is LogBook good for?
* Recording attendance, scoring students after class and assigning homework in the `Presence` section. 
* Check when your next class is in the `Calendar` section.
* View all students, including email or phone contact for their parents for emergency purposes and the ability to send a message for one or all students in the `Students` section
* Ability to view group participation in the `Group Participation` section. And hence the points given out in the past, whether the student was absent or late and how he/she performed in the tests.
* Materials that need to be studied before the lesson are in the `Learning Material` section.
* Potential losses for students who look like they will be leaving the Academy soon are in the `Potential Losses` section. This is the last clue where a student can still be helped before giving up completely.
* Homework will go in the `Homework' section.
* Ability to generate a report of hours worked in the `Reports` section. Especially useful at the end of each month.

#### Presentation - or attendance
Attendance is used in the first part of the lesson to record attendance. This is a very **critical part of the lesson**. If a student is absent from class (i.e. has a default `red'), after a few minutes 

TODO.

The class presentation is *only ever active on the day of the class*. If you want to add something afterwards, you can use the "Add data for another date" button. However, you can only request edits *three days back*, after that no one can do it, not even the main manager. So beware.

> Always watch out for that:
> * You have the correct attendance form at the beginning of the lesson.
> * At the end of the lesson or on the day, you have filled in the points
> Either way, you'll avoid any problems.

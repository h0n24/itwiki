# Most common problems with email

The most common problems are related to incorrectly entered URLs. 

## Wrong URL: account.microsoft.com

If an incorrect address is used, i.e. [account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com/), an error message is displayed:

```txt
AADSTS50020: User account 'jmeno@itstep.academy' from identity provider 'https://sts.windows.net/1c2aa41e-5b92-4906-827e-0c10f9d73859/' does not exist in tenant 'Microsoft' and cannot access the application '71dada86-21db-493b-93e4-1a902601f30f'(OneRenderFramework [wsfed enabled]) in that tenant. The account needs to be added as an external user in the tenant first. Sign out and sign in again with a different Azure Active Directory user account.
```

### The whole error then looks like this:

## Wrong URL: login.live.com

If an incorrect address is used, i.e. [login.live.com](https://login.live.com/), an error message is displayed:

```txt

```

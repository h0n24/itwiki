# Corporate email and Microsoft Exchange Cloud
Since most important business communication is done via email, it's a good idea to log into your email as soon as possible to make sure everything is working properly.

## Login

Email usually looks like `jm√©no@itstep.academy`.

Because email uses two-factor authentication, you need a mobile app from Microsoft called Authenticator ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=cs&gl=US), [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458)), which you need to have installed on your mobile phone in order to log in.

The address to log in is [login.microsoftonline.com](https://login.microsoftonline.com/).

Once you have successfully logged in at the link above, you can go straight to email from [outlook.office.com](https://outlook.office.com/).


## Most common problems

The most common problems are related to incorrectly entered URLs. 

### Wrong URL: account.microsoft.com

If an incorrect address is used, i.e. [account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com/), an error message is displayed:

```txt
AADSTS50020: User account 'jmeno@itstep.academy' from identity provider 'https://sts.windows.net/1c2aa41e-5b92-4906-827e-0c10f9d73859/' does not exist in tenant 'Microsoft' and cannot access the application '71dada86-21db-493b-93e4-1a902601f30f'(OneRenderFramework [wsfed enabled]) in that tenant. The account needs to be added as an external user in the tenant first. Sign out and sign in again with a different Azure Active Directory user account.
```

#### The whole error then looks like this:

### Wrong URL: login.live.com

If an incorrect address is used, i.e. [login.live.com](https://login.live.com/), an error message is displayed:

```txt
This account does not exist. Enter another account or get a new one.
```
